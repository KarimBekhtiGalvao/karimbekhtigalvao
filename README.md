🎄 Hey there! I’m Karim 👋 a social-minded engineering student with a knack for building smart, purposeful tech.

🚀 I love bringing ideas to life with Java, Python, and AI/ML magic - especially when it involves Trains 🚄🚄
💡 Currently crafting smarter systems, from distributed apps to intelligent bots - currently working on AI ChatBots ! 💬
🌍 Always learning, always tinkering — and occasionally breaking things (for science, and more often than not).
